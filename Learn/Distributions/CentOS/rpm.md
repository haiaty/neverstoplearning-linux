# What is RPM?

RPM Package Manager (also known simply as RPM), originally called the Red-hat Package Manager, is a program for installing, uninstalling, and managing software packages in Linux. 

Advantages of RPM include straightforward program installation and uninstallation, automatic installation, ease of updating programs originally installed with RPM, and availability of versions for most distributions of Linux. Limitations that have been mentioned include lack of backward compatibility or inadequate documentation for certain programs, and a relatively steep learning curve.

RPM maintains a database of installed packages and their files, so you can invoke powerful queries and verifications on your system. If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use the Package Management Tool to perform many RPM commands.

RPM is available under the Free Software Foundation GNU General Public License.
